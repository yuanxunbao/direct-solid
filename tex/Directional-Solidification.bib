abstract = {We present a detailed derivation and thin interface analysis of a phase-field model that can accurately simulate microstructural pattern formation for low-speed directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy. This advance with respect to previous phase-field models is achieved by the addition of a phenomenological "antitrapping" solute current in the mass conservation relation [A. Karma, Phys. Rev. Lett 87, 115701 (2001)]. This antitrapping current counterbalances the physical, albeit artificially large, solute trapping effect generated when a mesoscopic interface thickness is used to simulate the interface evolution on experimental length and time scales. Furthermore, it provides additional freedom in the model to suppress other spurious effects that scale with this thickness when the diffusivity is unequal in solid and liquid [R. F. Almgren, SIAM J. Appl. Math 59, 2086 (1999)], which include surface diffusion and a curvature correction to the Stefan condition. This freedom can also be exploited to make the kinetic undercooling of the interface arbitrarily small even for mesoscopic values of both the interface thickness and the phase-field relaxation time, as for the solidification of pure melts [A. Karma and W.-J. Rappel, Phys. Rev. E 53, R3017 (1996)]. The performance of the model is demonstrated by calculating accurately for the first time within a phase-field approach the Mullins-Sekerka stability spectrum of a planar interface and nonlinear cellular shapes for realistic alloy parameters and growth conditions.},

We especially seek to determine the growth directions and the stability of microstructures at various P{\'{e}}clet numbers when the crystal axes and the thermal gradient involve a misorientation. For this we perform experiments and simulations in the closest possible conditions referring to similar physical parameters and to a monocrystal growing in a thin sample by a single layer of homogeneously spaced microstructures. Implementing a 3D phase-field numerical code proves necessary to accurately model the solidification structures. A quite satisfactory agreement, both on qualitative and quantitative grounds, is found between experiments and 3D simulations, on both the growth directions of microstructures and the transition to the degenerate mode. This agreement provides a confirmation of the growth direction law evidenced experimentally and a fine validation of the 3D phase-field numerical model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {The tilted growth of dendritic arrays during directional solidification of non-axially oriented crystals has been simulated in two-dimensional system by using a quantitative phase-field model. A convergence study with respect to the diffuse interface width has been carried out, showing that the results are reasonably independent of the diffuse interface width for {\textless}sup{\textgreater}W0{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}d0{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}≤11.3. A parametric study is performed to investigate the effects of the primary spacing, the misorientation angle and the pulling velocity on the tip undercooling, the upper limit of primary spacing, and the tilted angle. Results show that the tip undercooling decreases when increasing the primary spacing or decreasing the misorientation angle. It has been found that the upper limit, resulting from tertiary branching, depends on both the solidification condition (the pulling velocity and the thermal gradient) and the preferred crystalline orientation (the misorientation angle) for the tilted growth of dendritic arrays. Previous rotation law, describing the relation between the tilted angle and the P{\'{e}}clet number, is evaluated according to phase-field simulation results. Moreover, the effect of the development of sidebranches on the growth direction selection was discussed. Further studies on the microstructure evolution from the onset of planar instability during directional solidification show that the selection of the steady-state primary spacing is sensitive to the misorientation angle.},

abstract = {We present an analytical treatment of (i) the incorporation of thermal noise in the basic continuum models of solidification, (ii) fluctuations about nonequilibrium steady states, and (iii) the amplification of noise near the onset of morphological instability. In (i), we find that the proper Langevin formalism, consistent with both bulk and interfacial equilibrium fluctuations, consists of the usual bulk forces and an extra stochastic force on the interface associated with its local kinetics. At sufficiently large solidification rate, this force affects interfacial fluctuations on scales where they are macroscopically amplified and, thus, becomes relevant. An estimate of this rate is given. In (ii), we extend the Langevin formalism outside of equilibrium to characterize the fluctuations of a stationary and a directionally solidified planar interface in a temperature gradient. Finally, in (iii), we derive an analytic expression for the linear growth of the mean-square amplitude of fluctuations slightly above the onset of morphological instability. The amplitude of the noise is found to be determined by the small parameter kBTEd0clT/$\gamma$$\lambda$c4 where $\gamma$ is the surface energy, d0c is the chemical capillary length, lT is the thermal length, and $\lambda$c is the critical wavelength.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The solidification microstructure in IN718 during additive manufacturing was modeled using phase field simulations. The novelty of the research includes the use of a surrogate Ni–Fe–Nb alloy that has the same equilibrium solidification range as IN718 as the model system for phase field simulations, the integration of the model alloy thermodynamics with the phase field simulations, and the use of high-performance computing tools to perform the simulations with a high enough spatial resolution for realistically capturing the dendrite morphology and the level of microsegregation seen under additive manufacturing conditions. Heat transfer and fluid flow models were used to compute the steady state temperature gradient and an average value of the solid-liquid (s-l) interface velocity that were used as input for the phase field simulations. The simulations show that the solidification morphology is sensitive to the spacing between the columnar structures. Spacing narrower than a critical value results in continued growth of a columnar microstructure, while above a critical value the columnar structure evolves into a columnar dendritic structure through the formation of secondary arms. These results are discussed in terms of the existing columnar to dendritic transition (CDT) theories. The measured interdendritic Nb concentration, the primary and secondary arm spacing is in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements performed on the nickel-base superalloy IN718.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Karma1998,
abstract = {We report the results of quantitative phase-field simulations of the dendritic crystallization of a pure melt in two and three dimensions. These simulations exploit a recently developed thin-interface limit of the phase-field model @A. Karma and W.-J. Rappel, Phys. Rev. E 53, R3017 {\~{}}1996!{\#}, which is given here a detailed exposition. This limit makes it possible to perform efficient computations with a smaller ratio of capillary length to interface thickness and with an arbitrary interface kinetic coefficient. Simulations in one and two dimensions are first carried out to test the accuracy of phase-field computations performed within this limit. Dendrite tip velocities and tip shapes are found to be in excellent quantitative agreement with exact numerical benchmarks of solvability theory obtained by a boundary integral method, both with and without interface kinetics. Simulations in three dimensions exploit, in addition to the asymptotics, a methodology to calculate grid corrections due to the surface tension and kinetic anisotropies. They are used to test basic aspects of dendritic growth theory that pertain to the selection of the operating state of the tip and to the three-dimensional morphology of needle crystals without sidebranches. For small crystalline anisotropy, simulated values of s* are slightly larger than solvability theory predictions computed by the boundary integral method assuming an axisymmetric shape, and agree relatively well with experiments for succinonitrile given the uncertainty in the measured anisotropy. In contrast, for large anisotropy, simulated s* values are significantly larger than the predicted values. This disagreement, however, does not signal a breakdown of solvability theory. It is consistent with the finding that the amplitude of the cos4f mode, which measures the departure of the tip morphology from a shape of revolution, increases with anisotropy. This departure can therefore influence the tip selection in a way that is not accurately captured by the axisymmetric approximation for large anisotropy. Finally, the tail shape at a distance behind the tip that is large compared to the diffusion length is described by a linear law r;z with a slope dr/dz that is nearly equal to the ratio of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional steady-state tip velocities. Furthermore, the evolution of the cross section of a three-dimensional needle crystal with increasing distance behind the tip is nearly identical to the evolution of a two-dimensional growth shape in time, in accord with the current theory of the three-dimensional needle crystal shape.},

abstract = {We use a computationally efficient phase-field formulation to investigate the origin and dynamics of sidebranching in directional solidification for realistic parameters of a dilute alloy previously studied experimentally. Sidebranching is found to result either from noise amplification or from deterministic oscillations that exist both in two dimensions and in a three-dimensional thin-sample geometry. The oscillatory branch of growth solutions bifurcates subcritically from the main steady-state branch of solutions and exists over a finite range of large array spacings. In contrast, noise-induced sidebranching is associated with a smooth transition where the sidebranching amplitude increases exponentially with spacing up to nonlinear saturation due to the overlap of diffusion fields from neighboring cells, as observed experimentally. In the latter case where sidebranching is noise-induced, we find that increasing the externally imposed thermal gradient reduces the onset velocity and wavelength of sidebranching, as also observed experimentally. We show that this counterintuitive effect is due to tip blunting with increasing thermal gradient that promotes noise amplification in the tip region. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Thermal modeling by finite element analysis simulates the laser melt pool, with surface temperatures in agreement with in situ thermographic measurements on Inconel 625. Geometric and thermal features of the simulated melt pools are extracted and used in subsequent mesoscale simulations. Solidification in the melt pool is simulated on two length scales. For the multicomponent alloy Inconel 625, microsegregation between dendrite arms is calculated using the Scheil-Gulliver solidification model and DICTRA software. Phase-field simulations, using Ni–Nb as a binary analogue to Inconel 625, produced microstructures with primary cellular/dendritic arm spacings in agreement with measured spacings in experimentally observed microstructures and a lesser extent of microsegregation than predicted by DICTRA simulations. The composition profiles are used to compare thermodynamic driving forces for nucleation against experimentally observed precipitates identified by electron and X-ray diffraction analyses. Our analysis lists the precipitates that may form from FCC phase of enriched interdendritic compositions and compares these against experimentally observed phases from 1 h heat treatments at two temperatures: stress relief at 1143 K (870 °C) or homogenization at 1423 K (1150 °C).},

@article{Tourret2015,
abstract = {We report the results of an extensive phase-field study of the growth competition of columnar dendritic grains in two dimensions. We investigate the influence of the temperature gradient and grain bicrystallography on the selection of both grain and microstructure, focusing on a geometry with two grains with principal crystal axes oriented parallel and at a finite misorientation angle with respect to the axis of the temperature gradient. Our first main finding is that, for well-developed dendritic structures forming at a low-temperature gradient, the rate of elimination of the misoriented grain is a non-monotonic function of the difference in undercooling between the dendrite tips of the two grains. Hence this rate cannot be predicted even qualitatively by the common assumption that the elimination rate increases with this undercooling difference. The breakdown of this assumption is particularly striking for highly misoriented dendritic and degenerate structures that persist for very long times despite growing at a substantially larger undercooling than the well-oriented neighboring grains. Our second main finding is that microscopic thermal fluctuations at the origin of sidebranching can induce significant variations in the macroscopic trajectories of grain boundaries (GBs), thereby making grain selection a stochastic process, while yielding limited variations in the selected primary spacings. In contrast, in the absence of fluctuations, GB motion becomes essentially deterministic and grain elimination is suppressed. In addition, our simulations reproduce quantitatively scaling laws deduced from experiments for both the primary dendritic spacing and the dendrite growth direction of misoriented grains. They further reveal that the "intergrain" primary spacing selected by tertiary branching events at GBs is systematically larger than the "intragrain" primary spacing selected by the transient growth competition between primary branches within a single grain, while obeying the same scaling laws. Finally, the fact that the rate of grain elimination is slower in our 2-D simulations than in experiments suggests that the 3-D grain bicrystallography plays a key role in grain selection. This role is interpreted in the light of 2-D simulations that hinder sidebranching on the misoriented grain.},

abstract = {We investigated the competitive growth of dendrites at the converging grain boundaries (GBs) of bicrystals during the directional solidification of an Al-Cu alloy by means of two-dimensional phase-field simulations. In particular, the focus was on the recently observed phenomenon of unusual overgrowth during the directional solidification of a Ni-based superalloy, where the favorably oriented (FO) dendrites are overgrown by the unfavorably oriented (UO) ones. The phase-field simulations were accelerated by parallel computations on graphics processing units. The simulation results showed that unusual overgrowth occurs in Al-Cu alloys, indicating that this phenomenon is a common one in metallic materials. It was also concluded that the differences in the diffusion layers in front of the FO and UO dendrites had a dominant effect on the competitive growth of dendrites at the converging GB as well as on the unusual overgrowth. In addition, unusual overgrowth was observed in all the FO dendrites with a spacing that allowed the dendrite array to grow stably without necessitating a change in the number of dendrites. The FO dendrite at the GB is overgrown by the UO dendrite when the spacing between the FO dendrite at the GB and the next FO dendrite is approximately equal to the critical minimum spacing. However, the unusual overgrowth was not observed for UO dendrites with a large inclination angle. In this case, all the UO dendrites are blocked by the FO dendrite at the GB, and the FO dendrites migrate toward the UO dendrites.},

abstract = {The segregation and morphology of liquid channels at the last stage of solidification are closely related to hot cracking formation. We use Phase-Field (PF) simulations to investigate liquid channel characteristics during columnar growth of single-crystal and bi-crystal Al-Cu alloys. It is found that the back-diffusion is weak in Al-Cu alloys. Liquid channels in Al-2.0, 3.0 wt{\%}Cu alloys coalesce into droplets above the eutectic temperature while the reduced Hot Cracking Susceptibility of Al-4.0 wt{\%}Cu can be correlated to eutectic formation at the root of liquid channels. For bi-crystal growth, we demonstrate that non-equilibrium solute segregation at intergranular liquid channels (prospective Grain Boundaries (GBs)) depends on the convergent/divergent growth conditions between grains, and their misorientation angle. Divergent growth leads to stronger solute segregation as more solute diffuses laterally into divergent intergranular channels. It is thus expected that for the same GB energy, intergranular channels with higher solute composition can extend to lower temperatures, thus promote hot cracking. We introduce an approach for combining solid fraction vs. temperature curves calculated from microstructurally complex PF simulations with hot cracking models in the literature to predict the nominal composition with the highest HCS. Preliminary results from this work agrees well with experiments.},

abstract = {Hot cracking is one of the major defects in continuous casting of steels, frequently limiting the productivity. To understand the factors leading to this defect, microstructure formation is simulated for a low-carbon and two high-strength low-alloyed steels. 2D simulation of the initial stage of solidification is performed in a moving slice of the slab using proprietary multiphase-field software and taking into account all elements which are expected to have a relevant effect on the mechanical properties and structure formation during solidification. To account for the correct thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the multicomponent alloy grades, the simulation software is online coupled to commercial thermodynamic and mobility databases. A moving-frame boundary condition allows traveling through the entire solidification history starting from the slab surface, and tracking the morphology changes during growth of the shell. From the simulation results, significant microstructure differences between the steel grades are quantitatively evaluated and correlated with their hot cracking behavior according to the Rappaz-Drezet-Gremaud (RDG) hot cracking criterion. The possible role of the microalloying elements in hot cracking, in particular of traces of Ti, is analyzed. With the assumption that TiN precipitates trigger coalescence of the primary dendrites, quantitative evaluation of the critical strain rates leads to a full agreement with the observed hot cracking behavior. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society and ASM International.},

abstract = {Convection during directional solidification can cause defects such as freckles and misoriented grains. To gain a better understanding of conditions associated with the onset of convective instabilities, flow was investigated using three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics simulations in an experimentally obtained dendritic network. A serial-sectioned, 3D data set of directionally solidified nickel-base superalloy measuring 2.3 × 2.3 × 1.5 mm was used to determine the permeability for flow parallel and normal to the solidification direction as a function of solid fraction (fS). Anisotropy of permeability varies significantly from 0.4 {\textless} fS {\textless} 0.6. High flow velocity channels exhibit spacings commensurate with primary dendrite arms at the base of the mushy zone but rapidly increase by a factor of three to four towards dendrite tips. Permeability is strongly dependent on interfacial surface area, which reaches a maximum at fS = 0.65. Results from the 3D simulation are also compared with empirical permeability models, and the microstructural origins of departures from these models are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.},
